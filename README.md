## Modern Firebase v1

A parallel Firebase/GCS implementation lives in the `apps/web`, `firebase`, and `functions` directories. Rails remains unchanged.

## Legacy ➜ Firebase migration (v1.1)

Use the TypeScript CLI in `scripts/migrate_legacy_to_firestore` to export legacy Postgres data, import it into the Firestore emulator (or production), and validate counts. See `docs/migration_v1_1.md` for prerequisites, commands, and data mapping notes.

### Local quickstart

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd functions && npm install
   cd ../apps/web && npm install
   ```
2. In `firebase/`, start the Emulator Suite (auth, firestore, functions):
   ```bash
   firebase emulators:start
   ```
3. In another terminal run the Next.js client:
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   cp .env.example .env
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000`, sign in anonymously, create/join rooms, and chat in real time. The callable `ensureNymProfile` sets your deterministic nym identity; Firestore rules enforce cloak mode and membership.

See [`docs/modernization_v1.md`](docs/modernization_v1.md) for architecture details, rules, and seeding helpers.
